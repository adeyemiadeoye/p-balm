This repository implements a proximal augmented Lagrangian method for solving nonconvex structured nonlinear programming problems as described in the paper [*A proximal augmented Lagrangian method for nonconvex optimization with equality and inequality constraints*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02894) by Adeyemi D. Adeoye, Puya Latafat and Alberto Bemporad (2025).

To run the examples, first install `pbalm` in editable mode:

    pip install -e .

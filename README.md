# pbalm

Python implementation of [PBALM](#citation).

**pbalm** solves optimization problems of the form:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\min_{x} \quad & f_1(x) + f_2(x) \\
\text{s.t.} \quad & g(x) \leq 0 \\
& h(x) = 0
\end{aligned}
$$

where $f_1$ is smooth (possibly nonconvex), $f_2$ is possibly nonsmooth but prox-friendly, and $g$, $h$ define smooth inequality and equality constraints, respectively.

Quick example:

```bash
python3 -m pip install pbalm
```

```python
import jax.numpy as jnp
import pbalm

def f1(x):
    return jnp.sum(x**2)

# L1 regularization (nonsmooth)
lbda = 0.1
f2 = pbalm.L1Norm(lbda)

# inequality constraint g_j(x) <= 0; j=1
def g_1(x):
    return x[0] - 0.8

# equality constraints h_i(x) = 0; i=1,2
def h_1(x):
    return x[0] + x[1] - 1.0

def h_2(x):
    return x[1] * x[2] - 2.0

x0 = jnp.array([1.0, 1.0, 2.0])

# create problem and solve
problem = pbalm.Problem(f1=f1, f2=f2, g=[g_1], h=[h_1, h_2])
result = pbalm.solve(problem, x0=x0, tol=1e-6)

print(f"Solution: {result.x}")
```
